# The results of my work in CESR (Kassel University) for VAINT project

**Project purpose:** Improving the current phenology of vegetation and photosynthesis in the COSMO model. Preparing the work for a future implementation in the ICON model. 

**Project tasks:**
1. Developing the new vegetation parameterisation scheme for COSMO-CLM v5.16 and v6.0 based on CLM and SURFEX models;
2. Adaptating and implemeting new vegetation parameterisation scheme into COSMO-CLM v5.16 and v6.0;
3. Developing the instruments for postprocessing model results;
4. Developing the instruments for data analysis and visualisation; 

Depending on the project task, the different methods and programing languages were used for achieving the final results:
